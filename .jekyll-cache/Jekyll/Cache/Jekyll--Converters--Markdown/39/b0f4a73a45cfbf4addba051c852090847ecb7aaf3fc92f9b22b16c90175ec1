<p>Kali 2.0 has been released for a while. Most people install Kali on the hard drive through a usb drive. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of people having problems of â€œblack screen after booting from EFIâ€, â€œgot a very small freezing menu in the top left cornerâ€ and â€œLegacy bootloader not foundâ€ when trying installing on a Mac. After a few days exploring, I found a solution to the booting issue (and network driver), and now it runs perfectly on my MBP 2015.</p>
